    <section>
      <h2>1. Quality Trends</h2>
      <p>
        The quality of agricultural products is increasingly driven by <span>consumer demand</span> for safety,
        sustainability, and nutritional value.
        Trends such as the adoption of <span>organic farming</span>, the use of precision agriculture, and implementing
        strict
        <span>quality control measures</span> have become essential.
        Additionally, certifications like <span>GlobalG.A.P</span> and the use of smart technologies to monitor product
        quality are shaping the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        These trends not only enhance trust in the agricultural supply chain but also promote long-term sustainability
        while meeting
        international export standards.

      <h2>2. Identification of Problem Areas</h2>
      <p>
        Despite advancements, several challenges persist in the agricultural sector. A significant issue is the
        <span>inequality in access to modern technology</span>,
        leaving small-scale farmers unable to compete with industrial producers. Furthermore, <span>post-harvest
          losses</span> caused by inadequate storage
        and transportation infrastructure remain a critical problem, especially in developing regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another concern is the <span>overuse of chemicals</span> like pesticides and fertilizers, leading to soil
        degradation and health risks. Lastly,
        <span>climate change</span> continues to disrupt farming patterns, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies
        to counteract its effects.
